<!-- Badges are dynamic: CI reflects the latest master run; npm/GitHub-Packages track the published
     version (GitHub Packages via the release tag — Maven coords and releases move together); the
     OpenSSF Scorecard badge is populated by .github/workflows/scorecard.yml. No version is hardcoded.
     The GitHub Packages badge uses include_prereleases because releases are tagged as pre-releases
     while the SDK is pre-1.0. -->

Part of **[Mosaicast](https://github.com/mosaicast)** — an extensible website platform for podcasts. Status: **v1 in development**.

This repo is the **hard contract boundary** of the whole system: core AND every plugin compile against it, and it depends on neither. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the big picture and `docs/BRIEF.md` for this repo's scope.

## Layout

```
plugin-api/        Java: the plugin contract (interfaces + records, no impl)   → dev.mosaicast.plugin.api.*
plugin-testkit/    Java: test doubles (FakePluginContext, InMemoryDocStore, …) → dev.mosaicast.plugin.testkit.*
src/index.ts       TS:  @mosaicast/plugin-sdk — PluginContext, defineMosaicastElement, createPluginI18n
src/testing.ts     TS:  @mosaicast/plugin-sdk/testing — makeMockCtx
```

The contract version is a **single SemVer anchor** mirrored in four places that MUST move together
(CI enforces it): `build.gradle.kts` · `package.json` · `PlatformApi.VERSION` · `PLATFORM_API_VERSION`.
A breaking change is a major bump; the host rejects plugins with an incompatible `platformApi` at startup.

## Build & test
```bash
./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal   # Java: both JARs (+ sources & javadoc) → ~/.m2
npm ci && npm run build               # TypeScript: src → dist (.js + .d.ts)
./gradlew test  &&  npm test          # all tests
```

## Using it
- **Java (plugin backend)** — three ways to obtain the artifacts:
  - Composite build (nicest during parallel dev): `includeBuild("../mosaicast-plugin-sdk")`.
  - Local: `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`, then depend on `dev.mosaicast:plugin-api:<version>`.
  - Released: from **GitHub Packages** (see below).
  ```kotlin
  dependencies {
      compileOnly("dev.mosaicast:plugin-api:0.3.0")           // contract, provided by the host
      testImplementation("dev.mosaicast:plugin-testkit:0.3.0") // test doubles only
  }
  ```
  Sources + Javadoc JARs give IDE hover docs automatically.
- **TypeScript (plugin frontend):** `npm install @mosaicast/plugin-sdk` (published on npm), or `npm link` / a tarball for local dev. `.d.ts` + TSDoc give IDE hover docs.
- **The source of truth for signatures** is this built SDK + its docs.

### Consuming released Java artifacts (GitHub Packages)
GitHub Packages requires authentication even for public reads. In the consumer's `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/Mosaicast/mosaicast-plugin-sdk")
        credentials {
            username = providers.gradleProperty("gpr.user").orNull ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
            password = providers.gradleProperty("gpr.token").orNull ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        }
    }
}
```
The token is any GitHub PAT with `read:packages`. (Anonymous-pull via Maven Central is a possible future move.)

## Plugin data access (v1) — plugins do not define HTTP routes

This is the part plugin authors most often guess wrong, so it is stated plainly. **A plugin's server side is `register(ctx)` — that is the whole of it.** There is no route-registration or HTTP-handler API in the contract, and its absence is a design decision, not a gap (ARCHITECTURE §7.4/§7.5; the generic doc store is the default).

**Backend.** A plugin persists *everything* through `ctx.store()` — the hard-scoped `DocStore`, addressed by `(Scope, key)` — and does any aggregation in `ctx.onSchedule(...)`. (The only alternative is a relational schema *declared in the manifest* and reached via `ctx.schema()`; still not a route.)

**Frontend.** A Web Component reaches plugin data through `ctx.api` (`PluginApiClient`). Those calls do **not** hit plugin-authored routes — they hit a fixed, generic surface the **host** exposes over that same doc store, namespaced per plugin. It mirrors `DocStore` one-to-one — `get` / `put` / `list` / `delete`, and no more:

```text
GET    /api/plugins/{id}/data/{scopeType}/{scopeId}/{key}
         → one JSON doc; 404 if absent
GET    /api/plugins/{id}/data/{scopeType}/{scopeId}?prefix=&page=&size=
         → { items: [{ key, value }], page, size, totalElements, totalPages }
PUT    /api/plugins/{id}/data/{scopeType}/{scopeId}/{key}   (JSON body)
         → upsert, last-write-wins
DELETE /api/plugins/{id}/data/{scopeType}/{scopeId}/{key}
         → remove; idempotent
```

| Operation | Backend (Java) | Frontend (TS) |
|---|---|---|
| read one | `store().get(scope, key, T.class)` → `Optional<T>` | `ctx.api.get<T>('data/…/{key}')` |
| list by prefix | `store().query(scope, prefix)` → `List<DocEntry>` | `ctx.api.get<PagedDocs<T>>('data/…?prefix=…')` |
| upsert | `store().put(scope, key, value)` | `ctx.api.put('data/…/{key}', value)` |
| remove | `store().delete(scope, key)` → `boolean` | `ctx.api.delete('data/…/{key}')` |

- `scopeType` is `site | feed | season | episode` and `scopeId` is that entity's id — mirroring `Scope`/`ScopeType`, the same addressing the backend uses. **`site`'s `scopeId` is always `main`** (`Scope.SITE_ID`): there is only one site, so both the SDK and the host normalize every site scope to that singleton — `Scope.site()` and `…/data/site/main/{key}` address the same document, and the path always has four non-empty segments.
- `key` must match `DocStore.KEY_PATTERN` = `^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,200}$` and is the final path segment, verbatim — no `/`, and no percent-encoded slash either (servlet containers reject `%2F` there). Structure keys with `:` / `.` / `-` instead, e.g. `mark:userId:cell`. The host answers 400 on a bad key, and `InMemoryDocStore` throws `IllegalArgumentException` — so it fails in your tests, not in production.
- The list is **paginated** (core's standard `PagedResponse` envelope) and **carries keys** (`DocEntry`), because neither end can address a doc without one.
- `delete` is **idempotent**: removing an absent doc is not an error. The Java call returns whether anything was actually removed.

**The two ends see one store.** The doc a backend writes with `ctx.store().put(scope, key, value)` is exactly what the frontend reads at `GET /api/plugins/{id}/data/{scopeType}/{scopeId}/{key}`.

**What the host enforces**, so a plugin doesn't have to:
- Data is **hard-scoped to the plugin id** — a plugin can only ever see its own data.
- **Reads** are gated by the slot's `visibleTo`; **writes** require the mapped role. The host validates that the scope exists (and that the feed is enabled). `ctx.api` carries the user's auth (session or personal access token).

**No request-time server logic.** A write is plain persistence — no plugin code runs on the request. Anything derived, validated or aggregated server-side is **precomputed** in `register`/`onSchedule` and read back from the store.

> Roadmap: custom plugin-defined server routes may arrive in a later `platformApi` version; plugins use the doc store.

## Releasing (maintainers)
Publishing is automated and fires on a **published GitHub Release**, not on PR merge
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
1. `scripts/set-version.sh <version>` — bumps the SemVer anchor in all four sources at once.
2. Commit on a branch, open a PR, merge to `master` (CI `version-parity` guards drift).
3. Draft a **GitHub Release** with tag `v<version>` and publish it.
4. The release workflow verifies the tag equals the anchor, rebuilds + tests, then publishes
   `@mosaicast/plugin-sdk` to npm (OIDC trusted publishing, with provenance) and the Java artifacts to
   GitHub Packages. A tag/anchor mismatch fails the release before anything is published.

## Test kit — mini examples

**Java** (`plugin-testkit`, no core, no DB):
```java
var ctx = new FakePluginContext();               // in-memory store, config, feeds; sync onSchedule
myPlugin.register(ctx);                            // exercise the backend
assertEquals(Optional.of("world"),
        ctx.store().get(Scope.site(), "hello", String.class));
```

**TypeScript** (`@mosaicast/plugin-sdk/testing`, jsdom):
```ts
import { makeMockCtx } from '@mosaicast/plugin-sdk/testing';

const el = document.createElement('bingo-episode-card') as HTMLElement & { ctx: PluginContext };
el.ctx = makeMockCtx({ scope: { type: 'episode', id: 'ep-1' } });
document.body.appendChild(el);
expect(el.shadowRoot!.querySelector('.card')).not.toBeNull();
// el.ctx.api is a MockApiClient: assert el.ctx.api.calls after interactions
```
